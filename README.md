```

Examples
--------

### Get the number of papers for *neural networks*.

``` r
library(petroOne)

my_url <- make_search_url(query = "neural network", how = "any")
my_url
#> [1] "https://www.onepetro.org/search?q=neural+network&peer_reviewed=&published_between=&from_year=&to_year="
get_papers_count(my_url)

Get total number of papers
--------------------------

in multiple pages of 1000 rows (or papers each)

``` r
# we use "conference-paper" only because other document types have
# different dataframe structure

                          how = "all",

                          rows = 1000)

get_papers_count(my_url)
#> [1] 2687
# 2661
# 2697 @ 200171009
